/**
 Use the ATTAdView class to embed advertisement content in your application.  To do so, you simply create an instance of the ATTAdView object 
 and add it to a UIView.  An instance of ATTAdView is the means for displaying advertisements from the ad publisher's site.  
 
 The ATTAdView handles the rendering of any content in its area: text or images.  The ad view also handles user interactions with
 the advertisement content.  Ads generally have links that allow users to visit web sites.  To control all interactions implement the 
 ATTAdViewDelegate protocol.
 
 Advanced ad view customization is supported.  Ad content can be filtered using the premium property.  Use the properties minSize and maxSize
 to configure ad content size in server response.  Also you can set the search parameters using the keywords.
 
 
 Set the delegate property to an object conforming to the ATTAdViewDelegate protocol if you want to listen the processing of ad content.
